# PAT (HTML Mail Embedding)
PAT is a command-line mailing tool that allows for HTML embedding within messages. It operates by scanning a specified file for HTML embedding which is compiled into a formatted message within the application. When attempting to connect to your account, if issues are encountered regarding authentication then ensure that you are complying with company security policies. For example, Google allows you to create a separate password for third-party applications such as this one.
# Application Usage
## Issues:
- The command-line features are currently very minimal, however, I plan to extend the tool to be much more user friendly.
## Support:
This tool, to the best of my knowledge, is functional on both **Linux** and **Windows**. All of the modules within the script are cross-platform, therefore, if you encounter any issues please inform me if you see fit.
## Requirements:
- SMTP Library
- MIME Library
```
python -m pip install ./requirements.txt
```
## Summary:
This application can be used to achieve great results, however, it can also be used maliciously. Any malicious use of this software is done so at the risk of the user partaking and not the developer. I **DO NOT** condone the misuse of this software.
